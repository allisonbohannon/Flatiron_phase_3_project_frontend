# My Reads Flatiron Portfolio Project

## Project Purpose
This project is intended to fulfill the requirements for the Flatiron School Phase 3 project. This repository serves as the front end for a RESTful API allowing the user to make all CRUD requests to the backend. 

## Project Description
This application allows a user to keep track of their reading list. They can add a book, author, and genre, which will then be added to their "To Be Read" list. Users can delete books from the list, or mark them as read. Books that are marked as read are moved to the Completed Reads list. 


## Running the project locally
